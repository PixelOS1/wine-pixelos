To compile Wine-PixelOS you will need to clone this repo with its submodules.

Many solutions out there for other distros have opted to use mingw to compile Wine. Our solution opts to use gcc. The reason is quite simple. The majorty of the issues we have encountered have all been due out of date mingw packages or packages crashing for no clear reason. mingw is a great cross compiler and should be considered for compiling Windows libraries but for our purposes we simply don't need the noise.
